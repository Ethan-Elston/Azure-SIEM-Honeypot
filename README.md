# Building a SIEM/Honeypot in Azure

## Objective

This project was designed to enhance my understanding of cloud security and threat intelligence by leveraging Microsoft Azure's SIEM and honeypot capabilities. My goals included:
- Gaining hands-on experience with cloud environments, particularly Microsoft Azure.
- Learning how to build and configure a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and deploy a honeypot.
- Developing threat intelligence techniques, such as mapping real-world attacks on a global threat map.
- Understanding log analysis and how to ingest custom logs into SIEMs and honeypots for security monitoring.
- Exploring Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) security by analyzing failed login attempts.
- Observing and analyzing real-time, real-world cyberattacks against my configured systems to gain deeper insights into attacker behavior.

This project provided hands-on exposure to active threat monitoring, SIEM functionality, and real-world cybersecurity threats.

### Skills Learned

- Cloud Security & Azure Administration – Deployed and managed a honeypot VM in Microsoft Azure to attract real-world attackers.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) – Configured Azure Sentinel to ingest, analyze, and correlate security logs for threat detection.
- Threat Intelligence & MITRE ATT&CK Analysis – Used Azure Sentinel’s built-in MITRE ATT&CK framework to cross-reference detected attack patterns, identify TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and quantify attacker behaviors.
- Log Analysis & Custom Logging – Developed and integrated custom PowerShell scripts to log failed RDP attempts, enrich data with a geolocation API, and ingest logs into Azure Log Analytics.
- Scripting & Automation – Automated security event collection and analysis using PowerShell, improving threat detection efficiency.
- Incident Analysis & Attack Investigation – Monitored and analyzed real-time attacks using Azure Sentinel, identifying trends in unauthorized access attempts.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Security – Investigated failed RDP login attempts to assess potential brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks.
- Threat Mapping & Visualization – Configured Azure Sentinel to generate global threat maps, providing a visual representation of attack origins and frequency.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure – Deployed and managed cloud-based virtual machines and security services.
- Azure Sentinel (SIEM) – Configured and utilized for real-time security monitoring, log analysis, and threat intelligence.
- Azure Log Analytics – Created and managed custom logs for security event ingestion and analysis.
- PowerShell – Developed automation scripts for logging failed RDP attempts and integrating external data sources.
- IPGeolocation.io – Used to enrich logs with geolocation data for attacker IP addresses.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) – Analyzed unauthorized access attempts to identify attack trends.
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework (Azure Sentinel Integration) – Utilized Azure's built-in MITRE ATT&CK feature to cross-reference detected attack patterns, analyze TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and quantify attacker behaviors.
- Threat Intelligence & Attack Mapping – Configured Azure Sentinel’s threat intelligence tools to visualize attack origins on a world map and identify recurring attack patterns.
